Important:

This app relies on two external libraries which are not checked into this repo
1. Android AppCompat Library V7 - This is a standard android library which can 
be included by following the instructions at 
https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res
2. ViewPager Circle Indicator - This is a 3rd party library which has been modified
a wee bit. The entire thing has been zipped and stored on Linode (currently) under
the home directory ViewPagerCircle.zip
